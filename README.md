## Hurdles & Challenges :mute:

$ Attempted to incorporate both Spotify and Soundcloud APIs over the weekend, but had issues with obtaining music tracks to play and OAuth respectively
$ Conflicts during push/pull which occasionally resulted in broken parts and headaches - lots of constant bug fixing, especially towards submission date when the file was getting bigger with more constantly moving parts
$ Having to combine/merge work done separately onto one page/functionality - and getting that to work
